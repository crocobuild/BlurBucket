|I failed at everything until the age of 24.  Age 16:  Failed my Class XI exams.  Age 18:  Missed every good (and average) college.  Age 21:  Missed 80% classes, made no friends, average GPA.  Age 24:  Didn’t even qualify to sit for interviews at half the companies that came to campus.  That same guy went on to:  1. Support his mother 2. Pay off his family loans 3. Consistently perform well at his job 4. Save enough to start his own business  All in under 7 years.  Lesson?  Don’t measure yourself too early.  You're just a few years of consistency away from changing your life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |https://www.linkedin.com/posts/parantap-chowdhury_i-failed-at-everything-until-the-age-of-24-share-7424315303339311105-PFnd |The hook is good.

|Work for FREE.  I know you hate hearing this but  It's the truth.  You want $3000 per project with  → Zero portfolio. → Zero clients. → Zero proof.  Here's what actually works ↓  → Do 2-3 strategic free projects. → For REAL businesses. → Solve REAL problems. → Build REAL case studies.  (or you can ask them to pay whatever their budget is.)  Once you have solid experience with a solid portfolio then charge whatever you want.  Your skills mean nothing without proof. And proof requires work even if it’s paid or not.  So think about it.

|Death Wish Coffee ran a Super Bowl ad in 2016.  Cost: $5 million for 30 seconds.  Every marketing expert said they were insane.   A small coffee brand competing with Budweiser and Doritos?  Here's what happened:  Their site crashed in the first 90 seconds. Completely down.  By the time they got it back up (4 hours later), they'd lost an estimated 67,000 potential orders.  But here's the twist:  Those 67,000 people who couldn't buy?   They told everyone they knew about "the coffee that broke the internet."  Death Wish got 1.2 million social mentions in 48 hours.   All Organic.   When the site came back, they sold 6 months of inventory in 11 days.  The lesson nobody talks about:  The crash made it more desirable.  People don't brag about buying something that was easy to get. They brag about the thing they had to fight for.  Death Wish didn't apologize for the crash. They leaned in:  "We didn't expect this. You broke our site. This is what happens when 100 million people try to buy the world's strongest coffee at once."  They turned a technical failure into social proof.  Here's where it gets interesting:  3 months later, they intentionally created another "crash."  New product launch. Limited inventory. Site went down again (this time on purpose, for 20 minutes).  Same playbook. Same result.  The controversy:  Is manufacturing scarcity through fake technical problems ethical?  Death Wish never confirmed it was intentional. But their engineer quit 2 weeks after the second crash and told a reporter: "We knew exactly what would happen."  For your brand:  What failure could you weaponize into exclusivity? What "oops" moment could become your origin story? How do you make people fight to give you money?  Scarcity works.   But created chaos works better.|https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yojimmykim_death-wish-coffee-ran-a-super-bowl-ad-in-share-7419742723282296833-ZRzh           |Love how they structured it (one line one gap) and added number straightaway at the top.                                                                                                                                                            |
|Most ESOPs will never make you money.  Not because startups fail. Because employees never ask the questions that matter before accepting stock options.  I've watched engineers sit on "₹50 lakh ESOP packages" they couldn't sell, couldn't exercise, and eventually watched expire while the founders sold their own shares in secondary sales.  If you're being offered ESOP, these three questions will tell you whether you're holding value or worthless piece of paper:  1: "Can I exercise my options when they vest or only when the company allows it?"  If exercise is at the company's discretion, you don't own anything. Real equity means you can exercise on your timeline i.e., when stock options vest or at regular intervals.  2: "What percentage of the company do my shares represent on a fully diluted basis?"  "10,000 shares" means nothing without this context. I've seen offers that sound life-changing until you realise the fully diluted share count is 50 million and your stake is 0.02%. Ask for your ownership in fully-diluted basis.   If they won't share it, ask yourself why.  3: "If I leave, how long do I have to exercise?"  The industry-standard 90-day exercise window is a trap. You leave a job, and suddenly you owe lakhs in taxes to buy shares in a company you no longer work for, with no guarantee of liquidity.   Some companies now offer 5-10 year windows. Most don't. Know which one you're signing up for.  At the end of the day, your ESOP grant letter isn't a gift.   It is compensation for the effort you put in and it's money you deserve to see in your bank.

|I’m officially starting a new role as Product Owner at micro1!  I probably got into product by accident.  The reason, though, was simple: what does it take for a psychologist to move from HR into product? Humans.  From my first year in tech, working closely with candidates made patterns obvious. Where hiring processes broke, where tools added friction, where decisions ignored the people going through them. That is what pulled me in.  Curiosity turned into action pretty quickly. Scoping features, shaping workflows, getting involved wherever something needed to work better.  Product became a natural part of the work.  m1 is where this way of working had room to grow. A place to build, experiment, and ship something the whole team now uses.  Grateful to Ali for encouraging collaboration beyond job descriptions, Shweta, Gabriel, Thiago, and Sofia for helping shape this, my beloved recruitment team, always so full of ideas to improve the product, and to the engineering and design teams for building with so much dedication 💜   Here’s to more building                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |https://www.linkedin.com/posts/melina-chervone_im-officially-starting-a-new-role-as-product-ugcPost-7424138835338502144-T_qy|LinkedIn loves posts related to someone getting hired or changing positions, this one got great engagement                                                                                                                                          |
|I've spent 25 years building technology for artists. Now I'm building something to protect them.  Genotone is audio ingest admission infrastructure. The core principle is simple: If there is no valid token, the audio does not enter the system.  Not detection. Not rights policing. Not enforcement. An admission gate - cryptographic proof of authorship embedded at source, verified before distribution or AI training begins. Author-signed, not platform-issued. Artists control their own keys - this isn’t rented identity, it’s owned sovereignty.  Why now?  The EU AI Act Article 50 enforcement begins August 2026. Platforms will need to demonstrate that audio in their systems was legitimately sourced. Right now, there's no practical way to do that at scale.  We're not asking platforms to become the police.   We're giving them a bouncer - verify at the door, not chase people down afterwards.  Where we are:   → V1.1 technical specification complete  → UK patent filed  → Research partnership with ETH Zürich alumni  → Industry coalition: AFEM, MMF, FAC  → Nominated to UK Government DCMS/DSIT Technical Working Group on AI and Copyright  What I'm looking for:   I'm raising seed funding to take this from specification to production over 24 months. I'm looking for investors, advisors, and collaborators who understand the intersection of music, technology, and creator rights                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrew-m-7bb864381_musictech-ai-copyright-share-7420060936855789568-Bh2T                     |Amazing Hook with a number - talks about what they did and what they are planning to do now.

|The only true form of failure:  Never starting.  I see this in 99% of "wantrepreneurs."  Talk, talk, talk. No action.  Sitting around waiting for the perfect idea, perfect timing, and perfect everything.  I get it.  I did the same thing for a year before I finally took the plunge.  Reading business books (very little help). Building big spreadsheets (I never used).  I told myself I was being strategic, but if I'm being honest, I was just acting scared.  Here's my advice to you:  1. Start ugly.  2. Figure it out in public.  3. Make mistakes and fix them in real time.  There's no other way around it.  You're gonna mess something up.  But all of the answers you're looking for are on the other side of starting.  If you're waiting for the "right moment," I want to help you stop doing that.

|Crazy story!   Basically, we’re into Reddit marketing, helping brands build presence on Reddit, LLMs & Google.   Last 7 days have been fortunately good for us. Closed 3 US clients.   But the story of this one YC client -   We pitched a month long plan & did 20-25% of actual work at the proposal stage!   Guess what happens next?   Instead of 1 month, we closed a 3-month long deal.   We were little skeptical about pitching 3 month straight up without any proof of work.   But but but,   If you don’t ask, the answer is always…. :)   Or as Chris Martin’s Fix You Lyrics goes:  “If you never try, you’ll never know”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |https://www.linkedin.com/posts/justinwelsh_the-only-true-form-of-failure-never-starting-share-7419949773467582464-fCMF      |This post went viral for the author - maybe because he started with "Crazy Story" and it was very easily digestibe.

|The game changed.  Just closed my first 7-figure deal.  No MBA. No McKinsey. No connections.  I was 20 when I started.  Felt like a kid on these calls. Young guy on Zoom trying to get taken seriously.  I could tell they were skeptical.  But here's what I learned:  Enterprise buyers stopped caring about pedigree. They care about speed.  They stopped caring about credentials. They care if you can solve their problem.  The old gatekeepers lost their power. Value finds its own path now.  The barriers you think exist are dissolving.  If you're building something real: Stop waiting for the perfect intro. Stop waiting for permission.  Just make it undeniably good.  The access will follow.
