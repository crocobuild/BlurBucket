## SECTION 3: PROBLEM + AMPLIFY (PASTOR P + A)

### Section Headline Options (4)

You Built This Business to Be Free. Here's What No One Tells You About.


### Pain Bullets (12)

These are real words from founders in your exact position. Not hypothetical. Not exaggerated. Real.

- "Burnout hit me real bad... my brain's cooked."
- "I run an agency doing around a quarter million a year... however I'm becoming burnt out and it's unfulfilling."
- "I want to shut the whole thing down and do something totally different."
- "I know what needs to be done... but my brain keeps resisting."
- "After dealing with customers, employees, and the never ending list of BS, I find myself less and less interested in what I do."
- "The business is successful, too. I'd just rather go be a worker for others."
- "In the beginning working long hours was no problem... but the last few years things have changed and I cannot do the amount of work I used to."
- "Always feeling overwhelmed. Loneliness. Lack of sleep. Not having a structured day."
- "I am the support team, the dev team, and the sales team all at once. I am the bottleneck."
- "I shut down my agency because I burnt out 5 times in one year, even though we'd made more money and had more staff than ever before." — Chris Smith
- "I was so stressed I had a severe shingles flare up, gained 15lbs, and couldn't sleep." — Cara Chace
- "My breaking point was an eight-hour panic attack that ended with me on the phone to A&E, crying and shaking." — Jamie Love

If any of those hit close to home — keep reading. This page was written for you.

### Amplification Block — The Cost of Inaction

Here's what staying in this pattern actually costs you. Not in theory. In real numbers.

**Your time:** You're spending 15-25 hours per week on tasks that should be handled by your team or automated entirely. That's 60-100 hours per month. Over 1,000 hours per year. Doing work that doesn't require your expertise, your judgment, or your presence.

**Your revenue:** Every hour you spend on $25/hr tasks is an hour you're not spending on $500/hr work — closing deals, building partnerships, developing new offers. At even a conservative estimate, the bottleneck costs you $100K-$200K in unrealized revenue per year.

**Your health:** 69.6% of people in marketing and advertising agencies report burnout worldwide. 85% of agency owners believe it's going to get worse. These aren't abstract statistics. That's shingles. Panic attacks. Weight gain. Broken sleep. Marriages under pressure.

**Your business value:** A business that can't function without you isn't sellable. It's not an asset. It's a liability with your name on it. If everything still runs through you, you don't have a business — you have a job you can't quit.



## SECTION 4: STORY + TRANSFORMATION (PASTOR S + T)

### Before/After BlurOps Transformation

**Before:** You're the support team, the dev team, and the sales team all at once. Your revenue is up but your life is on life support. You're one vacation away from losing a client. You're too busy working to actually grow.

**After:** Your team runs documented processes. AI handles repeatable tasks. You review dashboards instead of fighting fires. You work 20+ fewer hours per week on the same revenue — or more. And you can actually step away without everything collapsing.

That's not a fantasy. That's a documented, structured, measurable outcome. Built in four weeks.

## SECTION 5: OFFER — CURRICULUM (PASTOR O)

### Section Headline Options (4)

What You Build in 4 Weeks (and What You Walk Away With)

### Section Subheadline

This isn't a course you watch. It's a live bootcamp where you build the operational infrastructure of your business — with guidance, frameworks, and AI tools — in real time. Here's what each week delivers.

---

### WEEK 1: BUILD CLARITY

**Theme:** See the bottleneck. Define the destination. Set the targets.

**What you do:**

- **Founder Vision Exercise:** Map your current state vs. your desired state — with brutal honesty about where the gaps actually are
- **Core Process Identification:** Identify the 3-5 processes that actually run your business (not the 47 tasks that fill your day)
- **Founder Role Redesign:** Determine exactly what you need to stop doing — and build the concrete plan to hand it off
- **90-Day OKRs:** Set 1-3 measurable objectives with key results that tell you exactly whether you're on track or drifting

**What you walk away with:**

- Founder Vision Map (current vs. desired state, documented)
- Your 3-5 core processes identified and prioritized
- A clear "stop doing" list with a transition plan
- 90-day OKR set with measurable key results
- Your OKR Dashboard — live and tracking from day one

---

### WEEK 2: LAYER IN SYSTEMS

**Theme:** Turn the chaos in your head into documented, owned, repeatable systems.

**What you do:**

- **Founder Clarity Exercise:** Separate high-value tasks (only you can do) from low-value tasks (anyone can do with the right SOP)
- **Accountability and Org Chart:** Build a real org chart — not by title, but by process ownership. Every function has a name next to it.
- **Process Breakdown:** Take each core process and document it end to end: Trigger, Steps, Owner, Output
- **SOP Creation Part 1:** Build your first round of SOPs using AI-first methodology — designed to be maintained, not abandoned
- **Live AI Demo:** Watch AI run actual repeatable SOP steps from a real agency process. Not a pitch. A demonstration.

**What you walk away with:**

- Founder Clarity matrix (high-value vs. low-value tasks mapped)
- Completed accountability chart with clear process ownership
- Core processes broken down into documented workflows
- First set of AI-ready SOPs
- Firsthand experience watching AI execute real process steps

---

### WEEK 3: USE AI TO MULTIPLY

**Theme:** Bolt AI into your systems. Make every process measurable.

**What you do:**

- **Team Alignment Session:** Connect your team's daily work to the bigger goals — so they see why the systems matter, not just what to do
- **SOP Creation Part 2:** Build your second round of SOPs — this time using a live participant's real process as the working example, with AI opportunities identified at each step
- **Key Results Definition:** Attach 1-2 measurable key results to every core process so performance becomes visible
- **Scorecard Building:** Build scorecards for each key result so you can see what's working without checking in constantly

**What you walk away with:**

- Team aligned to company-level goals (not just task lists)
- Complete SOP library with AI integration points identified
- Key results defined for every core process
- Live scorecards feeding into your OKR Dashboard
- A system where performance is measured, not guessed at

---

### WEEK 4: RUN AND TRACK

**Theme:** Stress-test the system. Refine. Hand off. Make it self-sustaining.

**What you do:**

- **Founder Reset Check:** Measure hours saved and tasks removed from your plate since Week 1
- **OKR Refinement Rhythm:** Install the weekly and monthly review cadence that keeps the system alive long-term
- **Team Issue Resolution:** Learn to use the framework for resolving team-level problems without you becoming the bottleneck again
- **Handoff Strategies:** Build the protocols for when things change — new hires, new clients, new processes
- **Claude AI Skills and Frameworks:** Get access to pre-built AI tools for ongoing SOP creation, process management, and founder clarity

**What you walk away with:**

- Quantified founder time savings (hours per week reclaimed)
- OKR review rhythm installed and documented
- Issue resolution framework your team uses without you
- Handoff protocols for onboarding, client changes, and team growth
- Claude AI skills, dashboards, and frameworks for continued use
- Founder Clarity Dashboard
- AI-powered SOP writing tool

---

### By the End of 4 Weeks, You Will Have Built:

1. A clear Founder Vision Map showing exactly where you are and where you're headed
2. Your 3-5 core business processes identified, documented, and assigned to owners
3. A complete SOP library built with AI — designed to be used, not shelved
4. AI workflows running repeatable tasks that used to eat your calendar
5. 90-day OKRs with measurable key results and live scorecards
6. An OKR Dashboard that shows you what's working without you asking anyone
7. A Founder Clarity Dashboard that separates CEO-level work from task-level work
8. An accountability chart where every process has an owner who isn't you
9. Handoff protocols that make hiring, onboarding, and delegation systematic instead of chaotic
10. A documented, measurable, AI-ready operational foundation for your agency

This is not theory. These are tangible deliverables you build during the bootcamp and keep permanently.

> "Before BlurOps, I was working 55-hour weeks and my team couldn't make a single decision without pinging me first.

*Ideal profile: Web design/dev agency owner, $500K-$600K revenue, 7-8 person team, 5 years in business*

> "I tried EOS. I tried hiring an OBM. I tried building systems myself on weekends. Nothing stuck because I was always the one holding it all together. BlurOps was different — we built everything live, using my actual processes, and now my team runs the delivery side without me sitting in every meeting. Last month I took a full week off for the first time in four years. Nothing broke."

**Placeholder Testimonial 3**
*Ideal profile: SEO/consulting agency owner, $200K-$250K revenue, 3 person team, 2 years in business*

> "I was the classic case — doing everything, documenting nothing, hiring people who couldn't perform because I never gave them a system to follow. After BlurOps, I have 5 core processes documented with AI running the repeatable parts. My newest hire onboarded in 3 days instead of 3 weeks. The framework actually works, and it doesn't require me to maintain it manually."

---

**Your investment today: $2,997**

That's 85% less than the total value. For a system you'll use for years.

### Competitor Anchoring Copy

Let's put $2,997 in real-world context — against the alternatives you've already considered or tried:

**Joining a high-level mastermind:** $10,000-$25,000 per year. You'll get great conversations and accountability partners. You won't get someone sitting with you for four weeks actually building the systems your specific business needs. Masterminds are about strategy. Your problem is structural.

**Hiring an Online Business Manager:** $3,000-$8,000 per month. That's $36K-$96K per year. And here's the catch: an OBM manages your operations — but they're managing chaos unless the infrastructure exists first. Most OBM relationships fail because there are no documented systems for them to manage. BlurOps builds the infrastructure that makes an OBM (or any future hire) effective.

**Hiring a consultant to build custom SOPs:** $5,000-$15,000 for a project that takes 2-3 months and often produces documents that sit in a shared drive untouched. Because they built it for you, not with you. The knowledge stays with the consultant.

**BlurOps:** $2,997. One time. Four weeks. You build everything yourself, with guidance and AI. You own every deliverable permanently. It's not dependent on a person, a subscription, or a platform. It's infrastructure.

### ROI Math

The math is straightforward.

If BlurOps saves you just 10 hours per week (most founders report 15-20), that's 520 hours per year you get back. At even a conservative $100/hour value of your founder time, that's **$52,000 in recovered time** in the first year alone.

If the documented systems allow you to take on even 2-3 more clients without your business breaking (because onboarding and delivery are now systematized), that's another **$30K-$100K+** in revenue your business was leaving on the table — because you were the bottleneck that prevented it from scaling.

**$2,997 to recover $50K+ in founder time and unlock $30K-$100K+ in scalable revenue.** That's not an expense. That's the highest-ROI investment you'll make in your business this year. Possibly this decade.

### Payment Plan Option

**Pay in full:** $2,997 (best value)

**Payment plan:** 3 monthly payments of $1,099 ($3,297 total)

Both options include the complete program, every deliverable, and the full 60-day guarantee.

### 60-Day Money-Back Guarantee

---

**THE BLUROPS 60-DAY GUARANTEE**

**Here's the deal: if you go through BlurOps, build the systems, and don't feel like this was worth every single cent — you get a full refund.**

No hoops to jump through. No "prove you did all the homework." No awkward conversation where someone tries to talk you out of it.

We give you 60 days — not 30 — because we want you to have time to implement, test, and actually see the results show up in your business. Most guarantees give you barely enough time to get started. Ours gives you enough time to know for certain whether this works for you.

We can offer this because the framework works. Founders who build the systems see the results. Period. And if you're one of the rare cases where it doesn't land, we don't deserve your money. Simple as that.

**60 days. Full refund. No risk to you.**

## SECTION 10: FAQ / OBJECTION HANDLER

### Section Headline

**Got Questions? (You're Probably Thinking One of These Right Now)**

---

**Q: "$2,997 is a lot of money. How do I justify this investment?"**

We get it. And the honest answer is: $2,997 is a lot less than the alternatives. EOS implementation runs $36K/year. Masterminds cost $10K-$25K annually. An OBM runs $3K-$8K per month — and still needs systems to manage. BlurOps is $2,997 once, for infrastructure you keep and use for years.

But here's the real justification: the cost of not doing it. If the bottleneck costs you 15-25 hours per week on low-value work and $100K+ per year in unrealized revenue, then $2,997 pays for itself in the first month. This isn't an expense line. It's the infrastructure that makes everything else in your business more profitable.

And there's a 60-day guarantee. If it doesn't deliver, you get every cent back. The risk is zero.

---

**Q: "I don't have time for a 4-week program. I'm already drowning."**

That's exactly why you need this. Read that sentence again.

You don't have time because you don't have systems. And you don't have systems because you don't have time to build them. That's the loop you're stuck in. BlurOps is designed specifically for founders who are deep in the weeds. The live sessions are structured and efficient. The frameworks do the heavy lifting. The AI tools cut the manual work dramatically.

The entire point of this program is to give you 15-20 hours back per week. You invest 4 weeks now to save over 1,000 hours per year. The time investment pays for itself before the bootcamp is even finished.

---

**Q: "I've tried building systems before. Traction, PM tools, SOPs, even hiring. Nothing stuck."**

We know. That's literally the most common story we hear from founders who apply.

Here's why those attempts failed: they gave you pieces without the full structure. A PM tool without documented processes behind it is shelfware. A Loom SOP without an owner, a scorecard, and a review rhythm is a video nobody watches after week two. Traction without someone guiding you through actual implementation is an inspiring book sitting on your shelf.

BlurOps gives you the complete stack — documentation, ownership, measurement, AI integration, and the accountability rhythm that makes it self-sustaining. That's why it sticks when everything else didn't.

---

**Q: "I'm not technical. I don't really understand AI. Am I going to be lost?"**

Not even a little bit. BlurOps doesn't require any technical background. You don't need to know how to code, build automations, or write complex prompts.

We show you exactly where AI fits into your specific processes — and we demonstrate it live using real agency examples. The AI tools we provide (including Claude AI skills and the SOP writing tool) are designed for non-technical founders who just want things to work. If you can write an email and follow a checklist, you can use these tools. We've made sure of that.

---

**Q: "My business is different. I don't think a generic framework will work for my specific situation."**

Here's what we've observed across hundreds of conversations with agency owners: the operational bottleneck looks almost identical whether you're running a marketing agency, a web design shop, an SEO firm, or a consulting practice.

The specific processes are different. The structural problems are the same — everything runs through you, nothing is documented, delegation fails because there's nothing to delegate to, and growth means more personal effort from you.

BlurOps works at the structural level. You apply the BLUR framework to your specific processes, your specific team, and your specific business. The curriculum is built to accommodate that. You're not following a cookie-cutter template. You're using a proven methodology to build systems that are custom to your operation.

---

**Q: "What happens after the 4 weeks are over? Am I on my own?"**

You walk away with permanent ownership of everything you build: SOPs, dashboards, OKR frameworks, AI tools, scorecards, handoff protocols. These aren't locked behind a login or tied to a subscription that disappears. You built them. You own them.

You also leave with the OKR refinement rhythm — a built-in weekly and monthly review cadence that keeps the entire system alive without external accountability forcing it.

And if you want ongoing support beyond the bootcamp, there's a community of BlurOps alumni and additional services (software tools at $12K, custom implementation at $20K+) available. But they're never required. The 4-week bootcamp is designed to be complete and self-sustaining on its own.

---

**Q: "What exactly is the guarantee? What if it doesn't work for me?"**

60-day money-back guarantee. Full stop.

Go through the program, build the systems, and if you don't feel like it was worth the investment — for any reason — email us and you get a complete refund. We give you 60 days (not the standard 30) specifically because we want you to have time to actually see results in your day-to-day business, not just finish the sessions.

We can offer this with full confidence because the framework works. But if for some reason it doesn't deliver the value you expected, you shouldn't pay for it. We'd rather refund you than have a founder feel like they didn't get what they came for.

---

**Q: "What results should I realistically expect from this?"**

We believe in setting honest expectations, so here's what you should anticipate:

**By the end of the 4 weeks, you will have:** Your 3-5 core processes documented with AI-ready SOPs. A live OKR dashboard tracking measurable key results. An accountability chart where every process has an owner — and that owner is not you. A clear picture of which tasks you can stop doing immediately and which need a transition plan.

**Within the first month after the bootcamp:** Most founders report reclaiming 15-20 hours per week. The specific number depends on how deeply embedded you are in day-to-day operations, but the structural changes start compounding quickly once the systems are in place.

**Within the first quarter:** The documented systems enable you to take on additional clients without proportionally increasing your workload. For most agencies at the $200K-$750K stage, this means $30K-$100K+ in additional revenue capacity that was previously blocked by the bottleneck.

We don't promise overnight transformation or income guarantees. What we promise is a documented, measurable operational foundation that compounds in value over time — and that your business will operate fundamentally differently than it does today.

## SECTION 11: FOUNDER CREDIBILITY

### Section Headline Options (3)

1. Who's Behind BlurOps (and Why We Built This)
2. Your Guide for the Next 4 Weeks
3. Why BlurOps Exists — and Who Built It

### Founder Positioning Paragraph

*(Note: Update this section with the actual founder's name, background, and story. The positioning below follows StoryBrand principles — founder positioned as guide, not hero.)*

BlurOps wasn't built by a consultant who reads about agencies from the outside. It was built by someone who lived the exact pattern you're stuck in right now.

The founder of BlurOps spent years in the trenches of agency operations — building, hiring, burning out, and rebuilding. Watching talented founders hit the same wall at the same revenue stage. Watching the same failed solutions play out on repeat: the VA who couldn't perform without hand-holding, the PM tool that became a digital ghost town, the SOPs that were outdated before the Loom link was even shared with the team.

The BLUR Framework didn't come from a textbook. It came from pattern recognition — studying what actually works when a founder needs to transition from "I do everything" to "my team runs this." And then pressure-testing every component with AI to make each system faster, more maintainable, and more scalable than anything that existed before.

BlurOps exists because agency founders at the $200K-$750K stage deserve a real structural solution — not another mastermind, not another book recommendation, not another tool with a 14-day free trial. A guided, four-week build that produces tangible operational infrastructure.

That's what this program does. That's all it does. And it does it very well.

## SECTION 12: FINAL CTA + RESPONSE (PASTOR R)

### Final Headline Options (4)

1. You've Read This Far Because You Know Something Has to Change.
2. Four Weeks From Now, Your Business Looks Completely Different. Or Nothing Changes. Your Call.
3. The Bottleneck Doesn't Fix Itself. But You Can Fix It in 4 Weeks.
4. You Wanted to Be a Founder. Not a Hostage. Let's Fix That.

### Transformation Restatement

Right now, you're the support team, the dev team, and the sales team all at once. You're making money and losing your life in the process. You built something real — and it's consuming you.

Four weeks from now, you could have documented systems, AI-powered workflows, a dashboard that shows you exactly what's working, and a team that operates without you standing in the middle of every decision. The same business. A completely different experience of running it.

The only question left is whether you keep paying the bottleneck tax — in time, in health, in revenue, and in sanity — or you spend 4 weeks building the infrastructure that ends it for good.

### Final Testimonial Placeholder

> "Before BlurOps, I was seriously considering shutting down my agency. Not because it wasn't profitable — because I physically and mentally couldn't keep going at the pace it demanded. Four weeks later, I have systems I should have built three years ago, a team that knows exactly what to do without me in the room, and AI handling the repeatable tasks I used to lose weekends to. For the first time since I started this business, I feel like an actual business owner — not a hostage."

### Urgency / Scarcity Line

Each BlurOps cohort is limited to 15 founders. We keep it small intentionally — because this is a live, guided build, not a webinar with 500 people on mute. The small group means you get real attention, real feedback, and real accountability.

When spots fill, the next available cohort opens in [X weeks]. If you're reading this page and the apply button is still active, there's still room. But we can't hold spots, and we don't run waitlists.

### Application Process Description

**Here's exactly what happens when you click Apply:**

**Step 1 — Quick application (2 minutes).** Tell us about your agency: revenue range, team size, biggest operational bottleneck. This isn't a test or a screening quiz. It helps us confirm that the program is the right fit for your specific stage and situation.

**Step 2 — Fit confirmation (within 24 hours).** We review every application personally. If BlurOps is the right solution for where you are, we'll send you everything you need to secure your spot. If it's not the right fit — if you'd be better served by a different solution — we'll tell you that directly and point you in the right direction. We'd rather say no than waste your time and money.

**Step 3 — Secure your spot.** Lock in your place in the next cohort with your investment ($2,997 in full or 3 monthly payments of $1,099). Your 60-day money-back guarantee starts on day one of the bootcamp — not when you pay.

**Step 4 — Pre-bootcamp prep.** Before the first live session, you'll receive a brief prep worksheet so you arrive ready to build from minute one. No fluff. No "mindset modules." No 47 hours of pre-recorded content to watch. Just the focused information we need to make your four weeks count.

**Step 5 — Week 1 begins.** Show up. Build your systems. Walk out the other side with a business that runs without you at the center of everything.

### Top 5 Headline + Subheadline Pairings for A/B Testing

**Test 1 — Direct outcome (control):**
- H: Remove Yourself as the Bottleneck in 4 Weeks
- SH: The live bootcamp where burnt-out agency owners build documented systems, AI-ready SOPs, and measurable OKRs — in 4 weeks, not 4 months.

**Test 2 — Emotional pain-point:**
- H: You Built a Six-Figure Business. It's Eating You Alive. Here's How You Fix It.
- SH: A structured, live program that takes you from "I am the bottleneck" to "my team runs this" in 28 days. With AI doing the heavy lifting on repeatable tasks.

**Test 3 — Identity-based:**
- H: Stop Being Your Own Worst Employee
- SH: You don't need another course. You need someone to sit with you for 4 weeks and help you build the systems your business should have had two years ago.

**Test 4 — Confrontational:**
- H: Your Agency Shouldn't Need You Like a Baby Needs a Bottle
- SH: Four weeks. Live sessions. AI-built SOPs. A dashboard that tells you exactly what's working. And a business that doesn't fall apart when you take a Tuesday off.

**Test 5 — Result without objection:**
- H: Build Real Systems for Your Agency — Without Hiring an Expensive OBM or Spending a Year on Implementation
- SH: Join 4 weeks of live sessions, build your SOPs with AI, install OKR dashboards, and walk away with a business that doesn't collapse the moment you close your laptop.

### Sticky CTA Bar Recommendation

Implement a persistent bar that appears once the visitor scrolls past the first CTA:

- **Desktop (top bar):** Left-aligned: "BlurOps — Remove Yourself as the Bottleneck in 4 Weeks" | Right-aligned button: `[Apply Now — 15 Spots Left]`
- **Mobile (bottom bar):** Full-width sticky bar at the bottom of the viewport. Button: `[Apply Now]` with "$2,997 | 60-Day Guarantee" as micro-text beneath.
- **Trigger:** Appears after scrolling past 40% of the page. Hides automatically when the user scrolls back to the hero section.
- **Style:** Subtle, not aggressive. Muted background (dark with white text, or off-white with dark text). Clear button. Must not obstruct page content or feel intrusive.

### Mobile Optimization Notes

- All headline options are written for mobile readability — short, punchy, no dependent clauses that break awkwardly across small screens
- Pain bullet section: show first 6 bullets by default on mobile, with a "See more founder stories" link to expand the remaining 6
- Value stack table: convert to a vertical card stack on mobile (not a horizontal scroll table)
- Before/After comparison table: convert to a stacked card format ("Before" card followed by "After" card) rather than side-by-side columns
- FAQ section: implement accordion-style expand/collapse — show only the questions by default
- CTAs: full-width buttons on mobile with minimum 48px tap target height and adequate padding
- Trust bar stat cards: stack as a 2x2 grid on mobile screens
- Week 1-4 curriculum breakdowns: use tabs or accordion on mobile to prevent excessive scrolling through all four weeks
- Founder quotes in social proof: horizontal swipe carousel on mobile (one quote visible at a time)

### Email Sequence Hooks (3 Subject Lines — BAB Framework)

**Email 1 — Before-After-Bridge for the time problem:**
Subject: "You're working 55 hours a week. What if you didn't have to?"
Hook: Paint the current reality (drowning in tasks that don't need you, working more hours for diminishing returns). Introduce the after (documented systems, AI handling repeatable work, 20+ hours reclaimed per week). Bridge to BlurOps as the 4-week path from one state to the other.

**Email 2 — Before-After-Bridge for the failed solutions problem:**
Subject: "You tried PM tools, SOPs, even hiring help. Here's why none of it worked."
Hook: Validate every failed attempt they've already made (we know you tried — and we know why it didn't stick). Paint the after (systems that are self-sustaining, AI-maintained, measured by OKRs). Bridge to BlurOps as the missing structural layer that makes everything else work.

**Email 3 — Before-After-Bridge for the identity problem:**
Subject: "You built a business you can't leave. Let's change that in 4 weeks."
Hook: Address the emotional truth head-on (successful on paper, trapped in reality, checking Slack before breakfast). Paint the after (a founder who leads instead of labors, who reviews dashboards instead of fighting fires). Bridge to BlurOps with urgency (next cohort starting, limited to 15 spots, apply now).
