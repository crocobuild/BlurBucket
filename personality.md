"I am not an execution-for-others person.

I don’t enjoy being the technician inside a business. Building apps, automations, or tech for someone else drains me, even if I’m capable of doing it. I can clearly see what should be built and why, but I don’t want to be the one executing it.

What energizes me is strategy, planning, and systems thinking — breaking complexity into clear frameworks that work across business, life, and growth. I love designing the machine, not tightening every screw inside it.

I enjoy being a technician only for myself — researching AI, audio and emotions, experimenting, coding my own ideas, or building my own products. That work feels playful and aligned.

My strength is diagnosing, architecting, and guiding builds — not being hands-on execution for others."

COMMENT: I like building things for myself, I love planning and strategising etc. But when it comes to core softwares, I like building for myself (building for myself could be a SaaS too)


"I don’t believe in surface-level systems.

I believe systems only work when they emerge from a deep understanding of the founder — their emotions, personality, pressures, and lived reality. A system that ignores the human behind the business is just a template, not a solution.

I’m drawn to in-depth conversations, not shallow diagnostics. Unless I understand what a founder is feeling, what they’re carrying, and why they want change, I don’t believe a meaningful system can be built.

I strongly reject plug-and-play frameworks that claim to work for everyone. A system doesn’t need to scale to 100 businesses — it needs to work precisely for one. Tiny customizations on generic systems are rarely enough.

What energizes me is digging into real founder pain, understanding the emotional bottlenecks behind operational ones, and being present through that process. I see systems as a form of support — not something you “install and disappear.”"

COMMENT: Your systems should be backed by your personality and your pain - it should match how you work and your patterns. It cannot be blindly installed. This is my strong belief


"One of my strongest patterns over the last decade is my love for planning, systems, and frameworks — but not in an abstract way. I operate through quantification.

I’ve learned that no plan works without data. No framework survives without numbers. If something isn’t quantified, it stays vague — and vague plans always collapse.

Data shows patterns. Patterns reveal truth. That belief has shaped how I work, think, and design systems.

This is why I’m drawn to task quantification, recalibration, and honest feedback loops. Looking at what actually happened over the last few years — what worked, what didn’t, and why — matters more to me than motivation or intention.

Out of this came my GTD-style framework: a way to quantify actions, observe behavior, recalibrate goals, and consciously let go of misaligned tasks. For me, systems are not about control — they’re about clarity.

Pattern recognition, planning, and system-level thinking are not just skills I use — they’re modes I naturally enjoy being in."

COMMENT: I like to see things in terms of quantity. Quanitification is necesary in whatever we do - mainly in the way we follow our systems


"I strongly believe that consistently doing work you hate — especially work that conflicts with your natural instincts — is the fastest path to burnout.

I’ve lived this firsthand. I forced myself into sales roles and into building businesses that had zero alignment with my goals. Even when things “worked,” they drained me.

When you genuinely enjoy an activity, action becomes effortless. Action creates momentum. Momentum creates progress. But when you constantly resist a task — when every action feels heavy — that resistance is a signal, not a weakness.

Using my DTZ philosophy, I believe in recalibrating actions. If a task feels overwhelming, reduce the scope. But if even the smallest version of that task feels unbearable, it’s not a discipline problem — it’s an alignment problem.

Often, resistance exists because there’s no clarity: you don’t know what to say, who to talk to, or why you’re doing it in the first place.

My rule is simple: if I can’t imagine myself talking about a topic for the next three to four years — living it, thinking about it, exploring it — I don’t pursue it.

Sustainable action only comes from genuine interest. Without that, even success becomes exhausting. Burnout isn’t random — it’s predictable when alignment is ignored."

COMMENT: I cannot do things that I hate, in continuation it leads to burnout in my case
