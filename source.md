"During my school years, I was a consistent topper. I initially studied in Delhi until fourth standard, after which my family moved to Bangalore. From that point all the way till 10th standard, I remained a top-performing student.

I was extremely competitive by nature. I always wanted to come first and found it very hard to tolerate even three or four marks being cut. At the time, it felt like disappointing my mother or my teachers was unacceptable.

Alongside academics, I was very athletic. I represented my school in football and was part of teams that won a gold medal at the South Central regional level and a bronze medal at the inter-state DPS nationals. I also won multiple gold medals in 400m and 800m sprint events during school sports days, which I genuinely enjoyed.

Academically, I liked studying in a very straightforward way — absorbing information and reproducing it accurately on paper. I was highly obedient and dutiful towards my teachers. I didn’t want to upset them or see them disappointed, and in many ways, I was a people pleaser when it came to authority figures in school.

That broadly defines how I was as a student until the end of 10th standard."
"A lot changed for me during 11th and 12th grade. In 11th, I went through my first breakup, which was emotionally brutal. Around the same time, I was also a bit cocky about my academic abilities — and looking back, that was just a child being a child.

Academically, 11th and 12th were extremely difficult. The jump in complexity was massive. I couldn’t move forward unless I understood a topic completely — not just formulas, but the underlying concepts inside out. Hard concepts took me a very long time to grasp, and that slowed everything down.

Procrastination crept in heavily. If I didn’t understand something, I would take an entire week just trying to make sense of it. Alongside this, my mind was constantly occupied with emotional anxiety — worrying about texts not coming through, relationships, and uncertainty. Those thoughts ran in my head almost all the time.

I began taking long breaks and bunking classes, hoping to catch up on my own. But by the time I tried to catch up, new topics had already started, which made things worse. This created a vicious loop of falling behind, anxiety, and avoidance. Overall, 11th and 12th were a deeply anxious period for me, especially when it came to learning.

This phase also marked the beginning of something I later recognized as chasing uniqueness. Until then, I had naturally stood out. But during these years, I consciously started looking for identities that made me feel different — whether it was chemistry Olympiads or niche academic paths — as a way to define myself.

That pattern stayed with me in later years as well.

After 12th, I took a full year drop. During that year, I studied much better than I had in the previous two years and eventually made it into a decent college. That itself was a turning point, because nobody expected someone who had been a consistent topper to struggle so badly in 11th and 12th.

I hadn’t failed my board exams, but I couldn’t clear entrance exams, which forced the drop year. Even then, some habits persisted — bunking, low confidence, rising procrastination, and a complete lack of structure.

What I did enjoy during that time was planning. I loved writing down plans like, “I’ll do this in one day, this in three days, that in four days.” It was mostly tasks with timelines on paper. I enjoyed creating them, but I rarely followed through.

Looking back now, I realize the issue wasn’t discipline or intelligence — it was the absence of systems. Tasks alone didn’t matter. What I needed was a quantifiable, repeatable system to follow. But at that age, I simply didn’t know that."
"Joining college marked an important shift for me. Moving into a PG and staying away from home for two to three years gave me independence and space. I joined RV College in 2017 and pursued Computer Science and Engineering.

Academically, the first year and second year went well, and even the first half of third year was fine. Then COVID hit in 2020, and we were confined at home for almost a full year. Looking back, that period might have actually helped me — I’m not sure I would have cleared certain exams otherwise.

During my early college years, I had several positive experiences. I interned at IIT Guwahati for three months, attended TEDx, and began my design journey around 2017–2018. I also met Saurav Aria, who later became one of my closest friends, and hosted events together.

At the same time, old patterns persisted. I bunked classes frequently and spent a lot of time procrastinating. I made close friends like Abeer and Abhijit, and we had a great time together. Exams themselves were rarely the problem — I could usually manage marks.

The deeper issue was consistency. I wasted days, avoided structured work, and didn’t build momentum. Looking back now, systems would have helped immensely, but I didn’t know how to create or follow them.

Things escalated during my third year. My procrastination worsened to the point where I started missing exams altogether. I avoided college on days when I felt unprepared, which eventually led to conflicts with my HOD and teachers. Situations became tense and uncomfortable.

I began lying just to get time off, simply because I didn’t feel safe showing up unprepared. This avoidance loop — skipping, delaying, and hoping to reset later — mirrored patterns I had already developed during 11th and 12th grade.

There was never a moment where I felt truly prepared — only postponed. I had big ambitions and dreams, but no systems to execute them. Everything was pushed to “later.”

This mindset also affected placements. I kept telling myself I’d prepare for the next opportunity, but that moment never came. When COVID hit, I shifted fully into freelancing.

I do regret not taking placements more seriously and not building stronger coding fundamentals during college. But at the same time, that phase marked the beginning of something important — my design and freelancing journey.

During the COVID lockdown in 2020, I joined Upwork, and that’s where my freelance career truly began."
"After college, I didn’t join a company. I began my journey as a freelance content designer, initially earning anywhere between $50 to $300 per month. At that stage of life, even ₹25,000–30,000 per month felt massive — I was genuinely happy and grateful.

One moment that still stands out was my first real freelance gig. I initially thought the client was offering $5 for the entire project. Later, I realized it was $5 per hour. When he asked how many hours I worked and I said 20, he paid me $100. That moment felt surreal.

I remember thinking that if it really was just $5 total, I would’ve asked him to give it to someone who needed it more. But $100 felt life-changing at the time — I couldn’t refuse it.

Somehow, alongside freelancing, I completed college and graduated around March–April 2021. After graduating, I continued working on content design gigs.

Around that time, I joined the 10K Designers Cohort 4, a four-month program that began roughly a month after graduation. I was genuinely excited to learn and grow. I also worked as a content designer on Microsoft Ads and with Rustix for about one to one-and-a-half years.

That phase taught me a lot. I worked on posters and creative campaigns for well-known brands and celebrities. There were many moments of pride and happiness during this period.

Inside the 10K Designers cohort, I tried to transition seriously into UX design. But once again, an old pattern surfaced. I would start with high energy and motivation, but slowly drift back into procrastination.

I struggled to complete things consistently. There were no systems supporting me. Staying disciplined for multiple months felt impossible. Procrastination wasn’t just a habit anymore — it was actively impacting my life.

Delaying work, doing everything at the last moment, or finding reasons to escape responsibility became normal for me. If I couldn’t do something, I would justify it to myself. Over time, making excuses became automatic — and I hated that about myself."
"The year I graduated — 2021 — was one of the hardest phases of my life. I went through a bad breakup during my time at 10K Designers, around October–November.

To cope with it, I traveled to Meghalaya with a friend. During the trip, I had a minor accident on my hand, but we still managed to enjoy the journey.

After returning, I began traveling frequently — mostly as a way to escape. But somewhere inside, I felt resistance. A quiet inner voice kept telling me to slow down, stop running, and focus on work instead of constantly seeking distraction. I ignored that voice.

We had plans to travel to Nepal towards the end of November, but just before that, I underwent a major ankle surgery. That changed everything.

For the next four to five months, I was confined at home. I shut down all my work — ended client contracts, stopped working with Microsoft, and chose complete rest. My only responsibility during that period was recovery.

This phase began around December. And ironically, it became a turning point.

Towards the end of December, I started exploring no-code tools. It felt like a natural transition — slowly moving away from pure content and ad design, stepping back from UX (which I understood in theory but hadn’t practiced deeply), and entering the world of no-code.

I began experimenting with tools like Bubble, Softr, and Airtable. Over the next three to four months in early 2022, I became highly proficient with them.

In hindsight, that forced pause — which initially felt like stagnation — turned out to be one of the most formative periods of my journey."
"After entering the no-code world, my growth accelerated rapidly. I built a strong presence on Twitter around Bubble and became known as “the no-code guy.” I was fully riding that wave.

This momentum led me to join AirDev — a company known for hiring some of the best Bubble developers globally and working on high-quality, commission-based projects. I believe I was the first developer from India to join them, which felt like a significant milestone.

I worked with AirDev from mid-2022 until early 2023.

However, the same pattern resurfaced. I began procrastinating again — delaying client work, sometimes not working for entire weeks, and then rushing everything just before deadlines, creating unnecessary stress.

While I technically met deadlines, I knew this behavior wasn’t new. It was the same loop I had been stuck in since my school years — a complete absence of personal systems.

Interestingly, the only phase where procrastination didn’t exist was during AirDev’s onboarding. The process was structured, time-bound, and fully quantifiable — checklists, milestones, and clear end goals. During that period, I was extremely focused and consistent.

This reinforced a pattern I’ve seen repeatedly in my life: when goals are quantifiable and systems are clear, I perform at my best.

Project-based work, however, lacked that structure. Client feedback or change requests would frustrate me deeply and disrupt my mental flow.

Another painful realization was that I had stopped upskilling after joining. I constantly felt there was no time to grow — only time to execute. The mental noise, pressure, and lack of structure made emotional regulation difficult.

By early 2023, I had a clear realization: I may not be meant to work under others or focus purely on execution-heavy roles.

I deeply enjoy ideation, strategy, vision, and discussing how ideas can grow into something meaningful.

What I don’t enjoy — and actively resist — is ultra-technical execution: bug fixes, edge cases, and repetitive implementation work, especially when it’s for someone else’s vision.

Even though it paid well, it drained me."
"I ultimately decided to leave AirDev in early 2023. While my project manager became a major trigger, I also take responsibility for my own procrastination and delays on key features.

Toward the end, I found myself effectively working unpaid on a client project that required a complete revamp — something I no longer had the energy or ownership mindset to pursue. That was the breaking point, and I quit.

After that, I spent two months at home in 2023 recalibrating. My next move was launching Era of No-Code, a beginner-focused no-code cohort.

The first cohort was priced at ₹10,000 and attracted 15–20 participants. I genuinely enjoyed teaching beginners, creating Bubble tutorials, and treating the program as a pilot.

In 2024, I launched Era of No-Code Cohort 2, which coincided with a period of heavy travel. After recovering from a leg injury in 2022, I spent extended time traveling — including month-long stays in Rishikesh across multiple years.

By January 2024, I was in Rishikesh planning and marketing Cohort 2. We had rebranded, increased pricing, and scaled to 50–60 participants. On paper, it looked like a success: guest speakers, collaborations, and a richer experience.

However, internally, burnout had set in.

I no longer enjoyed recording video tutorials, taking frequent calls, or running ongoing operations. Marketing became stressful. If enrollments dipped, anxiety spiked.

I recognize that I didn’t manage Cohort 2 optimally, though participant feedback confirmed that the value delivered was strong.

Throughout 2024, I also traveled across India, visiting universities and collaborating with multiple communities — further draining my energy and finances.

By this point, I had exhausted myself trying to teach, market, operate, and scale everything alone.

In parallel, I discovered new creative outlets — including astrophotography during a 2023 trip to Zanskar, where I bought my first camera and reconnected with creativity.

Despite running Cohort 3 in 2024 and initially planning Cohort 4 for early 2025, I made a clear decision to stop.

The model wasn’t scalable in the way I needed. I wanted higher leverage and higher revenue. I no longer wanted to repeatedly market to small cohorts.

The no-code hype was flattening, and realistically, few were willing to pay beyond ₹50–60K for such programs.

By January, I shut everything down to reassess my direction entirely."
"In early 2025, I should have rested — but I didn’t.

Instead, I partnered with my close friend Sriraj, someone I had known since 2021–22. We had deep mutual respect — he’s exceptional at conversations and sales, and we’d spent years discussing ideas.

By March, we launched a new venture together. However, because Sriraj was still working in corporate, he couldn’t be the public face. That responsibility fell entirely on me — marketing, content, sales conversations, outreach, positioning — everything.

The problem was simple but fundamental: I don’t enjoy talking about conversations or sales theory.

And no matter how skilled you are, building content and a business around something you don’t enjoy is unsustainable.

By August, I burned out again — deeply.

I couldn’t look at my screen. I avoided work. I made excuses. Despite closing deals and helping people, the work drained me because it wasn’t aligned with my strengths.

I was exhausted from doing everything alone — thinking, deciding, executing, holding the entire structure together mentally.

In August 2025, I retreated again — spending a month in Zanskar and another in Ladakh.

On my return, I experienced intense physical reactions — shivers, dread, resistance. I didn’t want to go back to Bangalore. I didn’t want to continue.

At the same time, financial anxiety surfaced: If I stop working, what happens to my money?

After conversations with a few trusted people, I made the hardest but healthiest decision — I shut everything down until December 2025.

That pause turned out to be healing.

I stopped overthinking. I invested emotionally. I began therapy and spoke to a therapist every two weeks, which brought immense clarity and relief.

I returned to things I loved — reading, learning about audio emotions and AI, quiet curiosity.

I limited travel, except for a short trip to Bombay.

During this time, I met Yukti in September. She shared a similar journey — burnout from corporate and a conscious choice to step away and build her own path as a life coach.

Meeting her dismantled a core belief I carried — that connection only happens when you’re “at your best.”

Slowly, energy returned.

Clarity deepened.

I learned what I enjoy — and more importantly, what I will never force myself to do again.

The biggest realization was simple: if I don’t enjoy talking about something, I cannot build a business around it — no matter how profitable it looks.

This phase wasn’t about recovering from burnout.

It was about listening to it.

And letting it guide me forward."
"During this burnout phase, I uncovered a lot of unresolved inner-child conditioning.

One of the strongest patterns was guilt — especially guilt around asking for what I want.

I had internalized the belief that asking makes you an inconvenience, and that being an inconvenience is wrong. That belief had been shaping my decisions for years.

This phase helped me see how deeply that conditioning fed into procrastination, excuse-making, and avoidance loops.

I also noticed how prone I am to overthinking — particularly spiraling into worst-case scenarios.

I over-indexed on negatives:
– Fear of hiring
– Doubts about deserving support
– A belief that I should do everything myself
– A subtle entitlement that if I’m involved, I should keep all the money

One of the most freeing shifts was learning to say “I don’t know.”

That sentence brought me peace.

As Sriraj pointed out, it likely felt relieving because I’d been quietly carrying imposter syndrome for a long time — pretending certainty when I didn’t feel it.

I also gained extreme clarity about my strengths and dislikes.

I do not enjoy building for people.

What I love is:
– Strategy
– Planning
– Systems thinking
– Time, plan, and decision architecture

I enjoy seeing the whole machine — understanding how it works, how different systems connect, and how flow is created.

I do not enjoy working on inner mechanics — button placements, database wiring, micro-level technical execution.

Teaching also became clearer to me.

I enjoy teaching only when effort and returns are aligned.

Long group commitments drain me.

Short, high-impact, one-to-one engagements work — but only when they’re compensated at a level that respects the energy involved.

Perhaps the biggest change was emotional.

I’ve become more open, more expressive, and more honest about how I feel.

I no longer suppress confusion or force clarity.

And that openness feels grounding — like I’m finally operating from truth instead of performance."

"In January, when I started exploring the idea of helping founders by observing their businesses end-to-end and fixing gaps using systems and AI, I noticed something important.

Most people weren’t interested in the build itself — they were interested in clarity.

That insight pulled me deeper into the world of systems, SOPs, and structured thinking.

Through conversations — especially with Ranjit — I realized that systems work felt far more valuable and aligned than pure execution.

Around the same time, I received advice to return to my earlier sales-and-conversations model with Sriraj.

That suggestion created an immediate emotional repulsion.

The idea of selling something I didn’t deeply believe in — even if it generated cash — felt wrong at a gut level.

While I intellectually understand the importance of sales, emotionally it isn’t my domain.

I don’t enjoy selling for the sake of selling.

What I do enjoy is talking about systems — not as tools, but as frameworks for living and working better.

I enjoy exploring how fixing your day, your habits, and your internal structure changes outcomes.

I enjoy discussing strategy, self-worth, upper-limit problems, and how deeply those concepts are intertwined with systems.

Systems, for me, are not just operational constructs — they are reflections of personal identity and belief structures.

Recently, this realization has been reinforced through the books I’m reading.

The Big Leap explores the upper-limit problem.
You Are a Badass at Making Money reframes deservingness and wealth identity.
The Magic of Thinking Big challenges mental ceilings.
Work the System and The E-Myth ground all of this in operational reality.

Together, these books form a single narrative:

That systems, mindset, money, and identity are inseparable.

And that until you resolve internal limits, external systems will never scale.

It feels less like I discovered these ideas — and more like they discovered me."
"Why sales-only work repels you

Because:
        •        It bypasses truth
        •        It bypasses self-reflection
        •        It ignores identity
        •        It optimizes for extraction, not transformation

Your nervous system already knows this.

Why systems work attracts you

Because systems:
        •        Mirror internal beliefs
        •        Expose avoidance patterns
        •        Require honesty
        •        Create freedom without performance

You’re not moving away from money.
You’re moving toward money that doesn’t violate your values.

The unifying theme across all books you’re reading"
"While reading The E-Myth Revisited, I’ve been deeply resonating with its core idea: that a business should be designed as if it were a franchise from day one.

The book emphasizes systems — documenting every action, every interaction, and every decision — so clearly that the business could be replicated by thousands of people in exactly the same way.

This, according to Gerber, is the shift from being merely a business owner to developing a true entrepreneurial mindset.

He describes three roles that exist in every business: the entrepreneur, the manager, and the technician.

The entrepreneur thinks in terms of vision, structure, and outcomes. They look at the business from above, as a complete organism.

The manager builds systems, manages people, and ensures execution.

The technician focuses on doing the work itself — often becoming trapped in the details.

When technicians become business owners without developing entrepreneurial thinking, they tend to optimize only for short-term profit and personal effort, rather than long-term value for customers.

The distinction is subtle but powerful:

The technician asks, “What work needs to be done?”
The entrepreneur asks, “How must the business work?”

The entrepreneur starts with a clearly defined future and works backward to shape the present.
The technician starts with the present and moves toward an uncertain future.

This is why Gerber frames the business as an entity in itself — something that must be designed, not just operated.

His example of McDonald’s illustrates this perfectly: the success of the business is not rooted in what it sells, but in how it sells it.

One line that stayed with me deeply was:

“The true product of a business is not what it sells, but how it sells it.”

That idea alone reframes how I think about systems, value creation, and scale."
"I’ve been thinking deeply about the concept of Founder as a Bottleneck — the idea that many businesses don’t fail because of the market, the team, or the product, but because the founder never exits the technician role.

When a founder continues to operate as the primary doer — rather than as a designer of systems — they inevitably become the constraint that limits growth.

Even when the team scales beyond 20 people, the business begins to fracture because every decision, dependency, and escalation still routes back to the founder.

This isn’t about incompetence; it’s about role confusion. A founder who hasn’t learned how to think, delegate, and design at a systems level unintentionally caps the business’s potential.

I’ve started referring to this pattern as Founder as a Bottleneck (F-A-A-B) — and most small to mid-sized businesses are operating exactly this way.

The E-Myth reinforces this through another powerful idea: business as a product.

Michael Gerber explains that your business itself should be treated as the product — a franchise prototype that can run independently of you.

The shift happens when you stop working inside the business and start working on the business.

When the business is designed as a system — not dependent on the founder’s constant presence — scalability, clarity, and leverage naturally follow.

These ideas landed strongly for me because they explain, in simple terms, why so many founders feel stuck despite “working harder than ever.”"
"One major phase I want to talk about is the imposter syndrome I’ve gone through — especially around the idea of upper limits.

I learned about this concept from Gay Hendricks’ book The Big Leap. The idea is simple but brutal:
most people subconsciously upper-limit themselves. When things start going well, when momentum builds, when life or business feels like it’s about to level up — something inside us panics.

And then we fall back.

It’s not always conscious. In fact, most of the time it isn’t.

You start doing well → your nervous system doesn’t fully believe you deserve it → and suddenly things derail.

Sometimes it looks like:
	•	You fall sick right before an important meeting
	•	You get into a random accident when something big is about to happen
	•	You procrastinate exactly when clarity appears
	•	You sabotage momentum without even realising it

Your body reacts. Your behaviour reacts. Your environment reacts.

It’s almost like the world pulls you back to what feels normal and safe — even if that normal is anxiety, chaos, or under-earning.

I’ve seen this pattern repeatedly in my own life.

Whenever things felt like they were about to really work — not just okay, but well — I would unconsciously pull back. Either through overthinking, losing confidence, delaying decisions, or creating situations where things wouldn’t move forward.

That’s what the upper limit problem really is:
not believing, at a deep level, that good things can sustain for you.

Another idea from the book that stayed with me is this:
when you catch yourself overthinking or spiralling about things outside your control, you need to consciously shift your focus back to the positive spectrum.

Not blind positivity — but grounded optimism.

For example:
If I’m overthinking a decision, instead of feeding the fear loop, I ask:
“What if this actually works?”
“What if something good comes out of this?”
“What if this is safe for me?”

And then I put my energy there.

The more you practise this, the more your system slowly learns that success, stability, and growth are not threats.

This ties deeply into confidence and pricing as well.

In December 2024, when I first thought about starting Revamp8 seriously, my confidence was extremely low. I remember thinking:

“Should I just charge ₹50,000 for two months of work?”

That felt like a safe number.
Not exciting. Not aligned. But safe.

That was my upper limit at that time.

Since then, a lot has shifted — especially after collaborating with Ranjit and thinking more structurally about offers and systems.

Now, the funnel we’re thinking about looks very different:
	•	Entry through lead magnets and small paid products (around $19)
	•	Then a mid-tier bootcamp or cohort in the $699 range (eventually moving to ~$1899)
	•	And for founders who need deep, hands-on help with systems and implementation, a higher tier in the $6,000–$8,000 range

This shift didn’t happen overnight.

It came from:
	•	Understanding my own upper limit patterns
	•	Seeing how low confidence directly affects pricing and positioning
	•	Realising that I was undercharging not because of market reality, but because of internal fear

In December, there was still a lot of confusion, hesitation, and self-doubt.
But now I can see clearly that most of it wasn’t about capability — it was about permission.

Permission to earn more.
Permission to take up space.
Permission to believe that things can actually go right.

And I’m still working through this — consciously — every day."
"Attraction to Audio, Emotion & the Need to Feel Unique

Another thing worth mentioning is that since around August last year, I’ve been unusually attracted to audio- and emotion-based products—both thinking about them and exploring how they could be built.

I think this really started during one of the sessions we were conducting with Ranjit, in the sales and conversation program. Ankur was one of the clients in that session, and at some point he said something that really stuck with me. He said:

“I wish there was a device that could just hear me out, figure out where I was stuttering, where things went wrong in the conversation, what I should have said differently.”

At first, I thought this could be a simple one-week build. But it turns out—it absolutely wasn’t.

That one idea pulled me into a deep rabbit hole. I started reading extensively about audio processing, emotions, and speech analysis. I went into topics like Fourier Transforms, MFCCs, Mel Spectrograms, and a lot of signal processing fundamentals. I’m still learning about these things.

I don’t yet know exactly where this will take me, but what I do know is this:
for the last five to six months, this idea has felt heavy—in a good way.

It placed me in a space where I felt unique again.

Like:
“Okay, this is something interesting. This is something not everyone is doing.”

That feeling pushed me harder to explore it.

And when I reflect on it honestly, this pattern isn’t new.

It’s very similar to how, in 11th and 12th, I wanted to feel unique by diving deep into chemistry. Or how later, in different phases of my life, I was drawn to things that set me apart—whether it was no-code, teaching, or systems thinking.

This attraction to audio and emotion-based work fits that same pattern.

My original idea around December was actually very simple. I wasn’t trying to build something massive. I just wanted to earn enough—maybe ₹50,000 to ₹1 lakh per month—so I could comfortably continue my research and exploration around audio and emotions without financial stress.

That was the main intention.

Now, things are slowly becoming bigger. The scope is expanding. The business thinking is getting more serious.

So the question naturally arises:
Do I still want to continue in the audio-emotion space?

The answer is yes—but with clarity.

I want to explore audio and emotions in my free time, deeply and patiently. I want to keep learning, experimenting, and understanding it properly. But only after the business side of things is stable. Only after the current idea is validated, grounded, and working well.

Audio and emotion-based work feels like something I want to grow into—not something I want to force into monetisation prematurely.

For now, it stays close to me.
Quietly evolving.
Waiting for the right time."
"So I have this strong belief that to get people into a task, you can’t just say that in these 45 minutes, I will be completing the task, or in these 45 minutes, I will be making a content piece, in these 45 minutes, I will be heading to the gym, or things like that.

I think in Atomic Habits, the author has, or in The Power of Habit, right, the book, the author has told that there has to be a trigger for a certain event to happen, and trigger, action, and reward. I think that was the thing which was mentioned.

Also, this is not a transcription. I’m just talking to you. I’m just getting your thoughts as a life coach, as a business coach, motivation coach, a person who thrives in productivity and stuff.

So, I feel there should be an inward zone in the initial phase. So let’s take an example. If I ask you what was the one best thing that happened yesterday, worst thing, and one thing that could have made you angry but you were neutral. If I ask you what all happened yesterday, I think in my case, I’m going to be able to think.

But instead, if you quantify it, let’s say that what are these three questions, answer them based on your timeline between 6 p.m. to 12 noon and what all happened. And before you answer that, just tell us that I think the way to get into the zone over here is talk about what you did between 6 to 12 p.m. Now you are in the zone of 6 to 12 p.m. answering those questions, and then you ask about what all went good, bad, or neutral, etc.

Do the same thing for 12 to 6 new evening, and the same thing for 6 to 12 o’clock at night. So, everything, in my opinion, can be quantified. Everything.

I feel this goes with my vector theory that you can draw your skills as in a 2D vector and calculate something. I don’t know what that could be, but yeah, I think that everything can be quantified, and if you complete tasks in terms of quantification, that should work out.

I cannot simply write that I need to go to gym today. The thing needs to be that if I go to gym today, what am I doing, how long will I do each item for, and how many sets of each.

So you need to be, you do not need, you cannot be identified as a person who goes to gym for 45 minutes or one hour, but you can definitely be identified as a person who completes four variations and three sets for each of them.

At the same time, you cannot simply approach a place. So if it is like a 45-minute session on gym, The first few minutes, that can be a trigger exercise, just wearing your gym wear or your gym clothes, those have to be the trigger action, the triggers that prompts you to go, that makes you feel ready.

You need to set your environment in a way that you feel like going.

Let’s say that I need to talk to someone at 7 p.m. and I don’t want to, or I want to take a session at 7 p.m. You cannot simply say that I will be talking for one hour. You need to put on the timeline that, hey, for the first 30 minutes, I’m going to be just listening. The next 30 minutes, it’s going to go like this, where the first 10 minutes I’m going to talk about this, then this, then this.

And the zone to get into that those 7 p.m. moments is simply to switch on your camera and sit. That’s it. Any other action around, apart from that, will prompt you to procrastinate things.

Even as I overthink that what I’m going to put in each of my buckets and the constraint is right now I do not have my laptop in front of me. And if I do it on my phone, I’ll have to scroll all the way back and put it one by one on my laptop. Is it too bad? It’s not.

It’s just, it can happen or cannot happen or it happens later. It does not matter if you have the ability to take the action right now, forgetting about how to polish the action, forget about polishing the action, but can you take the action? That is way more important.

And you need to be, you need to slowly ooze into the zone of taking action in a certain time slot."
"I strongly believe that getting into action isn’t about assigning vague time blocks like “45 minutes for gym” or “45 minutes to create content.” That framing doesn’t work for me.

From books like Atomic Habits and The Power of Habit, the idea that resonates deeply is trigger → action → reward. Action doesn’t start with effort — it starts with a trigger that pulls you into the zone.

For me, this means creating an inward entry point before any task.

For example, instead of asking broad reflection questions like:
	•	What was the best part of yesterday?
	•	What was the worst?
	•	What made you angry but you stayed neutral?

I find it far more effective to anchor reflection to time blocks.

If I first place myself mentally in a specific window — say 6 a.m. to 12 p.m. — and ask, “What happened in this window?”, my brain enters that zone. Only then do questions about good"
