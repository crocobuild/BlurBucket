You built a business that needs you like a baby needs a bottle.
Your "freedom" looks a lot like 11pm emails and Sunday "catch-ups."
You're the CEO and the intern. And you know which one you feel like.
Six figures and you still can't book a flight without guilt.
You sold yourself a dream and bought yourself a nightmare.
Your business didn't scale. Your problems did.
You're rich on paper and broke on sleep.
Congrats—you're your own worst employee.
You're one vacation away from losing a client.
You made it. So why does it feel like a prison?
Your phone owns you. Your calendar owns you. Your business owns you.
You tell everyone you're crushing it. Your eye twitch says otherwise.
Six figures. Zero boundaries. That's not success.
You wanted to be a founder. Not a hostage.
Your revenue is up. Your marriage is on life support.
You're a 6-figure founder who can't take a piss without checking Slack.
You're one bad week from hating the thing you built.
You can't remember your last guilt-free weekend. That's insane.
Your "dream business" turned you into someone you don't recognize.
You check Slack before you kiss your kids good morning.
Your last vacation? You worked the whole time.
You're making more money and enjoying life less.
You built a business that can't survive without you. That's not an asset. That's a liability.
Your team asks permission to breathe.
You say "just this once" every single week.
You're one bad month from doing everything yourself again.
Six figures and still can't log off at 6pm.
You're the CEO, ops manager, and customer support. All at once.
Remember when you thought hitting 6 figures would feel different?
Your phone buzzes and your chest tightens. Every. Single. Time.
You haven't had a clear head in months.
You're too busy working to actually grow.
Your partner forgot what you look like without a laptop.
You're scared to check your inbox after lunch.
Taking a sick day means coming back to a dumpster fire.
You told yourself this year would be different. It's not.
You make the money. The business takes the life.
You're successful and miserable. Nobody warned you about that combo.
Your business is growing. Your patience isn't.
You can't remember the last time you were bored. And not in a good way.
You dream about work. Literally.
Sunday nights already feel like Monday.
You didn't sign up to babysit your own business forever.
You're winning on the outside. Drowning on the inside.
