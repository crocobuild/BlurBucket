### SUBHEADLINE OPTIONS (pick 1)
*Pairs with the chosen headline. Creates urgency + clarity of the offer.*

1. ★ **BlurOps is the 4-week operational bootcamp that helps six-figure founders build AI-ready systems, document their core processes, and finally step out of the day-to-day — without the business collapsing.**
2. **In 4 weeks, you'll go from doing everything yourself to running a business with documented systems, clear accountability, and a team that doesn't need you for every decision.**
3. **You don't have a revenue problem. You have a systems problem. BlurOps fixes it in 4 weeks.**
4. **The right systems let your business run without you. Not perfectly — just without you. We'll build them together in 4 weeks.**
5. **Most founders hire more people to solve an ops problem. That makes it worse. BlurOps teaches you to fix the structure, not add more heads to a broken machine.**
6. **You already have enough clients and revenue. What you don't have is documented systems, clear ownership, and a business that runs when you're not in the room. That's what we build.**
7. **Burnout isn't a personality flaw. It's what happens when a six-figure business is held together by one person. BlurOps is how you change that — in 4 weeks.**
8. **The businesses that scale don't have founders doing everything. They have founders who built the right systems, then stepped back. We'll show you exactly how.**
9. **Stop hiring to compensate for a lack of systems. Stop managing chaos. Start building a business that runs on process, not on you.**
10. **Agency founders are burning out at a 69.6% rate. The ones who escape have one thing the others don't: documented, AI-ready systems. Let's build yours.**
11. **You've been the product, the project manager, the closer, and the support desk. It's time to build a business where you're none of those things — unless you choose to be.**
12. **This isn't a productivity course. This isn't about working smarter. It's about building the operational infrastructure your business needs to run without you.**
13. **Your team doesn't need a better founder. They need better systems. BlurOps builds both — in 4 structured weeks.**
14. **The goal isn't to work less. The goal is to build a business that earns and runs without requiring your constant presence. That starts with systems.**
15. **You built the revenue. Now let's build the machine that sustains it — without you in the middle of every process.**

### Section Headline Options
1. ★ **Let's Call It What It Is.**

### Pain Block Copy (use as a list or stacked cards)

**Intro line (above the list):**
You've built real revenue. You have a real team. And somehow, every morning still starts with you.

---

**Pain Bullets** *(drawn from real founder accounts — these hit hard because they're real)*

- ✗ You can't take a week off without things falling apart.
- ✗ Your team can do the work — but only after asking you twelve questions first.
- ✗ You've tried ClickUp, Asana, Notion. The tools pile up. The chaos doesn't leave.
- ✗ You've recorded Loom SOPs that no one watches. Including you.
- ✗ You hired a VA to free up time. Instead, you got a new thing to manage.
- ✗ You know what needs to happen. You just can't get out of the day-to-day long enough to build it.
- ✗ You're making more money than you ever expected — and enjoying it less than you ever imagined.
- ✗ Your phone buzzes and your chest tightens. Every time.
- ✗ Sunday evenings already feel like Monday.
- ✗ You're the CEO, the escalation point, the quality checker, and the backup for everything.

---

### Bridge Statement (transitions from pain to solution)

**Option 1 ★:**
This isn't a discipline problem. It's a structure problem.

When a business is built around one person — their judgment, their knowledge, their constant presence — it doesn't scale. It just grows heavier. Every new client, every new hire, every new tool adds more weight to the one person holding it all.

The way out isn't working harder. It's building the systems that let your business run without you being the answer to every question.

That's what BlurOps teaches.

---

**Option 2:**
You didn't fail to plan. You just built a business before you built the infrastructure to support it. Most founders do. The ones who escape burnout aren't smarter or more disciplined — they're just the ones who stopped treating systems like a "someday" project and started building them deliberately.

BlurOps is the structured, 4-week program that walks you through building that infrastructure — process by process, system by system — until your business stops needing you in every room.

---

## SECTION 3: THE BIG IDEA / POSITIONING

### Section Headline Options
1. ★ **The Real Problem Isn't Revenue. It's That Your Business Lives in Your Head.**
2. **A Business That Needs You for Everything Is Not a Business. It's a Job You Can't Quit.**
3. **You Scaled to Six Figures. Now You Need to Scale Out of It.**
4. **What Got You Here Will Burn You Out There.**

---

### Body Copy

**Option A ★ (recommended):**

Here's the pattern we see over and over:

A founder builds something real. Revenue grows. A team gets hired. And instead of the business getting easier, it gets heavier. Because nobody ever built the systems that let it run without them.

Everything still runs through you. Every decision, every deliverable, every client issue. You're not the CEO of your business. You're the load-bearing wall.

And the advice you've tried hasn't helped. The books say delegate. You delegate — and quality drops. The frameworks say document. You record a Loom — and no one watches it. The masterminds say hire better. You hire — and now you have more people asking you questions.

The problem was never people or tools. It was that you never built the operational foundation underneath them.

**That foundation is what we build at BlurOps.**

---

**Introducing the BLUR Framework:**

BLUR is the operational system we walk every founder through in 4 weeks:

- **B — Build Clarity.** Identify what your business actually is: its core processes, your role in each, and the vision you're building toward. Map where you're stuck.
- **L — Layer in Systems.** Document every core process in a way that your team can follow, repeat, and improve — without you holding their hand.
- **U — Use AI to Multiply.** Turn your documented systems into AI-ready workflows. The processes that took you 3 hours now take your team 40 minutes.
- **R — Run and Track.** Install dashboards, OKRs, and scorecards so you can manage the business from above — not from inside every task.

Four letters. Four weeks. One business that stops requiring your constant presence.

---

## SECTION 4: CURRICULUM — "WHAT YOU'LL BUILD IN 4 WEEKS"

### Section Headline Options
1. ★ **Four Weeks. One Business That Runs Without You.**
2. **Here's Exactly What We Build Together.**
3. **The Curriculum Isn't Theory. Everything You Build, You Keep.**
4. **Week by Week. System by System.**

### Section Subheadline
*This isn't a course where you watch videos and take notes. It's a live bootcamp where you build the actual systems for your actual business — with guidance the entire way.*

---

### Week-by-Week Breakdown

---

**WEEK 1 — Founder Clarity & Business Vision**

*The goal: understand exactly where you are, where you want to go, and what's standing between those two points.*

What we do:
- **Founder Vision Exercise** — You document your current state vs. desired state. This becomes your north star for everything that follows.
- **Core Process Identification** — You identify the 3–5 processes that actually run your business. Not everything. The ones that matter.
- **Founder Role Redesign** — You get honest about what you must stop doing, what decisions no longer require you, and what your actual job should look like.
- **90-Day OKR Setup** — You walk out of Week 1 with 1–3 clear business objectives and an OKR dashboard to track them.

By the end of Week 1, you'll have:
✓ A clear founder vision document
✓ A list of your core business processes
✓ A Founder Role Clarity Sheet
✓ A live OKR dashboard (built in the session)

---

**WEEK 2 — Process Documentation & AI-Ready SOPs**

*The goal: take what lives in your head and put it somewhere your team can actually use.*

What we do:
- **Founder Clarity Audit** — You categorize every task you currently do as high-value or low-value. Then you identify the top 3–4 things only you should be doing.
- **Accountability Chart** — You build a clear ownership map. Who owns what. Who escalates to whom. No more "who's responsible for this?"
- **Process Breakdown** — For each core process, you write: the trigger, the steps, the owner, and the expected output. Same structure every time. Team-ready from day one.
- **SOP Creation (Part 1)** — You write your first real SOP — with AI-first switches built in. We show you exactly where AI can replace human effort in the steps that don't need human judgment.

By the end of Week 2, you'll have:
✓ A Founder Clarity audit (high-value vs. low-value task map)
✓ An accountability/org chart
✓ Structured process breakdowns for your core systems
✓ Your first completed AI-ready SOP

---

**WEEK 3 — Metrics, Scorecards & Team Alignment**

*The goal: make your systems measurable, and get your team rowing in the same direction.*

What we do:
- **Team Alignment Check** — You validate that your team understands and is aligned with your bigger goals. Misalignment is the silent killer of every system you build.
- **SOP Creation (Part 2)** — A live participant example. We identify exact AI opportunities inside real processes — not hypothetical ones.
- **Key Results for Each Process** — Every core process gets 1–2 metrics. If you can't measure it, you can't improve it. We define the numbers.
- **Scorecard Building** — You build a scorecard for your key results: how to measure them, how often, and what good looks like.

By the end of Week 3, you'll have:
✓ A team alignment framework
✓ A second AI-ready SOP
✓ Key results defined for every core process
✓ A built scorecard and OKR tracking dashboard

---

**WEEK 4 — Founder Reset, Handoffs & AI Tools**

*The goal: lock in the wins, measure what changed, and set up the ongoing rhythm that keeps this working.*

What we do:
- **Founder Reset Check** — You calculate how many hours you've reclaimed. Not estimated. Actual.
- **OKR Refinement Rhythm** — How often to review, what to adjust, and how to avoid OKR theater (OKRs nobody actually looks at).
- **Team Issue Resolution** — Frameworks for solving disagreements, misalignment, and accountability gaps without everything escalating to you.
- **Handoff Strategies** — The exact handoffs that let you grow without being the bottleneck in every transition.
- **Claude AI Skills** — Specific AI workflows we use inside BlurOps. Not general AI tips — the actual prompts and processes.
- **Dashboards & Tools** — Founder Clarity Dashboard, SOP writing tool, additional frameworks.

By the end of Week 4, you'll have:
✓ A clear picture of hours reclaimed
✓ A working OKR refinement rhythm
✓ Team conflict resolution frameworks
✓ Handoff playbooks
✓ A full AI toolkit for your operations

---

### "By the End of 4 Weeks" Results List

**By the end of BlurOps, you will have:**

- ✓ 3–5 fully documented core business processes
- ✓ Your first set of AI-ready SOPs (built during the bootcamp, not after)
- ✓ A live OKR dashboard tracking your 90-day objectives
- ✓ A scorecards system so you always know how your business is performing
- ✓ A Founder Role Clarity Sheet (what you must stop doing, and who owns it instead)
- ✓ An accountability chart your team can actually follow
- ✓ AI workflows embedded into your operations — not bolted on
- ✓ A business that can function without you in every room

### Placeholder Testimonial Block

**[TESTIMONIAL 1 — Primary ICP]**

> "Before BlurOps, I was the answer to every question in my business. After 4 weeks, I have documented processes for our 4 core systems, a team that knows who owns what, and I've already reclaimed [X] hours per week. The SOP templates alone were worth 10x what I paid."
> — [Name], [Agency Type], [Revenue range]

**[TESTIMONIAL 2 — Hours/Outcome Focus]**
*Ideal: Quantified result — hours saved, first vacation, first week not on call*

> "I took a full week off for the first time in [X] years. My team handled [specific scenario] without texting me once. I didn't think that was possible before BlurOps."

**[TESTIMONIAL 3 — Skeptic-to-Believer]**
*Ideal: Someone who had tried other tools/programs and failed*

## SECTION 6: WHO THIS IS FOR

### Section Headline Options
1. ★ **BlurOps Is Built for One Type of Founder. Are You That Founder?**
2. **This Works If You Fit This Profile.**
3. **We're Very Specific About Who We Let In.**

---

### "This Is For You If..." Block

This bootcamp is for you if:

- ✓ You're running a service-based business (agency, consulting, design, SEO, marketing) doing $150K–$800K/year
- ✓ You have a team of 3–10 people — but you're still involved in everything
- ✓ You've been in business for 2+ years and built real revenue, but the personal cost is getting too high
- ✓ You've tried tools, hired people, or read the books — and still feel like you're holding everything together with duct tape
- ✓ You want your business to be able to run for a week without you — not perfectly, just without collapsing
- ✓ You're willing to do the work during the 4 weeks (this is a live, active bootcamp — not a course to watch later)
- ✓ You want to build systems that actually fit your business — not cookie-cutter templates

---

### "This Is NOT For You If..." Block

This is not the right fit if:

- ✗ You're under $100K/year and still primarily focused on getting clients (you have a revenue problem, not a systems problem — yet)
- ✗ You want someone to build your systems for you without your involvement (we do offer that — see our Done-For-You service — but the bootcamp requires you to show up)
- ✗ You're looking for sales, marketing, or growth tactics
- ✗ You're not ready to be honest about how much of the operational chaos is self-imposed
- ✗ You think AI will just "fix" things if you connect the right tools (AI multiplies good systems. It amplifies bad ones.)

---

## SECTION 7: OBJECTIONS / FAQ

### Section Headline
**Good Questions. Here Are the Honest Answers.**

---

**Q: I've tried systems before. Traction, ClickUp, Notion. Nothing sticks. Why would this be different?**

Most systems fail because they're installed, not built. Traction is a great framework — but it's designed for companies with an EOS implementer guiding them over 12–24 months. ClickUp is a tool with no methodology behind it. BlurOps is different because we don't hand you a template and say "good luck." We build the systems specific to your business, in your business, during the 4 weeks. By the end of the bootcamp, your systems already exist and have already been used. There's no implementation gap.

---

**Q: I don't have time for a bootcamp. I'm already drowning.**

We know. That's exactly the problem. The reason you don't have time is because you haven't built the systems that would give it back. BlurOps is 4 weeks of investment that buys you back hundreds of hours per year. Every founder who goes through this program says some version of: "I should have done this two years ago." The cost of not doing it is measured in years of burnout, not weeks of effort.

---

**Q: Can't I just hire an OBM or operations consultant?**

You can. An OBM will typically cost you $3,000–$8,000/month and operate inside your existing chaos until they burn out too. The real problem isn't that you need another person — it's that your operational foundation doesn't exist yet. BlurOps builds that foundation first. After that, an OBM or operations hire actually works. Without it, you're hiring into a mess.

---

**Q: Will the AI stuff actually be useful, or is it just a trend?**

It's the most practical AI training most founders have seen. We don't teach "use ChatGPT for email." We teach you to build AI-first SOPs — where specific steps in your real processes are replaced with AI workflows that give your team the same output with a fraction of the effort. These are the actual workflows we use. Not prompts from a YouTube video.

---

**Q: What if my business is different from a typical agency?**

The BLUR Framework is built to work across service businesses: marketing agencies, SEO agencies, design studios, consulting firms, content agencies, niche service providers. The specific tools and SOPs vary. The structure — clarity, systems, metrics, AI — is universal. We also use live participant examples in Week 3, so you'll see the framework applied to businesses that look like yours.

---

**Q: What happens after the bootcamp?**

You leave with a complete operational infrastructure: documented processes, AI-ready SOPs, OKR dashboards, scorecards, and accountability frameworks — all built for your specific business. Founders who want to go further can apply for our Done-For-You System Implementation, where we build and install your complete operational architecture. That starts at $20,000. The bootcamp is the foundation. Everything else builds on top of it.

---

## SECTION 8: FOUNDER CREDIBILITY & OFFER BREAKDOWN

### Section Headline Options
1. ★ **Why BlurOps. Why This Framework. Why Now.**
2. **Built by a Founder Who Learned This the Hard Way.**
3. **This Isn't a Framework We Read in a Book. It's What We Build Every Day.**

---

### Founder Positioning Paragraph

BlurOps was built on one conviction: **a business that needs its founder for everything isn't a business — it's a job that just happens to pay the founder.**

We've seen what happens when revenue grows without operational infrastructure underneath it. The chaos scales with the revenue. The founder becomes the load-bearing wall of everything. And the "freedom" they built the business for gets pushed another year into the future.

The BLUR Framework was designed to break that pattern in the most direct way possible: 4 weeks, real systems, built for your specific business, with AI embedded from the start — not added as an afterthought.

We are not an EOS implementation firm. We are not a general business coach. We are operationally obsessed, AI-forward, and we work exclusively with service-business founders who are ready to stop being the bottleneck.

## SECTION 9: PRICING & FINAL CTA

### Section Headline Options
1. ★ **The Investment Is $3,000. The Cost of Waiting Is Measured in Years.**
2. **What Is Another Year of This Worth to You?**
3. **The Bootcamp That Pays for Itself in the First Month of Hours Reclaimed.**
4. **$3,000 for 4 Weeks. Then You Get Your Business Back.**

---

### Price Framing Copy

**Option A ★ (Recommended):**

The BlurOps Bootcamp is $3,000.

Not $36,000 for an EOS implementer. Not 12–24 months of slowly rolling out a framework. Not a masterminds group where 80% of the time is sales content and networking.

4 weeks. The exact systems your business needs. Built during the program, not after it.

If you reclaim even 10 hours per week — a conservative number for most founders who complete the program — and you value your time at $150/hour, that's $78,000/year of founder time returned. The bootcamp pays for itself in less than a week.

But the real math is this: what is another year of being the bottleneck actually costing you? Not just in hours. In health. In relationships. In the business ceiling you can't break through because you're in every room.

BlurOps is how you stop paying that cost.

---

**Option B:**

Most founders spend more than $3,000 per month on tools, subscriptions, and hires trying to solve an ops problem without a systems foundation. BlurOps costs $3,000 total — and builds the foundation that makes everything else work.
